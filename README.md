# Musical_Time_Machine
Using Python's BeautifulSoup, this project scrapes Billboard's Hot 100 chart for a user-specified date. It authenticates the user with Spotify Web API through Spotipy and adds song URIs to a new private playlist on the user's account. If a song is not found, a message is displayed. It's a handy tool to create playlists of top songs for any date
